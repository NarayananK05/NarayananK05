• 🧠 **AI Career Architect** – a personal AI career assistant that builds custom roadmaps (Streamlit + Gemini API)  
• 🧾 **Indian Constitution Chatbot** – an NLP-based chatbot for legal queries (Streamlit + FAISS + Gemini API)

🏆 **Achievements**:

⚽ Beyond tech, I enjoy football, managerial events, and taking initiative in college fests. I’m trilingual and thrive in leadership and teamwork environments.

🌱 My long-term goal is to evolve into a **Cloud and DevOps Engineer**, integrating AI and automation into resilient infrastructures.
